# Encounters With Chaos

This Unity project is a visual demonstration of the concepts explained in the book "Encounters With Chaos" by Denny Gulick. This involves C# scripts as well as HLSL shaders in order to fully demonstrate the mathematical theories.


## Requirements 
- Unity version 2022.3.6f1 or higher

## Chapters and Visualizations

- Chapter 1: Period-3 Points Demonstration
   - This visualization explores the concept of period-3 points in the logistic map. It allows you to interactively adjust the parameter 'a' and the initial value 'x0' to observe how the system evolves over a specified number of iterations. The visualization displays the logistic map points and highlights the period-3 points, providing a visual understanding of the stability and bifurcations in the system.

- Chapter 2: Cantor Sets Demonstration
   - The demonstration allows you to control the number of iterations, and line width to explore the intricate patterns that emerge. As you increase the iterations, the self-similarity and infinite complexity of the Cantor set reveal itself. This is a very rudimentary visualization of a fractal. 

- Chapter 3: Henon Map Demonstration
   - This demonstration presents a unique 3D visualization of the Henon map, a classic example of a chaotic dynamical system. The visualization allows you to adjust parameters such as the constants 'a' and 'b', and the number of iterations.
    
- Chapter 4: Julia Set Fractal Demonstration
   - In this representation of a Julia Set, users can adjust parameters such as the number of iterations and the complex constant 'c' to observe how different values give rise to strikingly different fractal patterns. The visualization also incorporates smooth coloring and a time-varying component to create visually appealing and dynamic representations of the Julia set. Additionally, the demonstration includes intuitive zooming and panning functionality.

- Chapter 5: Lorenz System Demonstration
   - This demonstration show a 3D visualization of the Lorenz system. Users can explore the system's behavior by adjusting key parameters such as the Prandtl number (σ), and the system parameter (β). The visualization employs vibrant color gradients and smooth trail rendering to create visually striking representations of the system's trajectories.
